# LoginPageGo
## Login/Register application made in Go + HTMX + Templ + Tailwind

I've included the .go generated by ```templ generate``` so you only needs to run ```go run .```

Doesn't show any info at the page on login/register attempts, at the moment only shows messages at the server console, but the main logic has been stablished. (I'm just too lazy to build a attempt verification page)

(If you don't have the go installed, there's an alpha release that may help you test this.)
